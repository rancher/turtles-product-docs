= Create & Import Your First Cluster

This section will guide you through creating your first cluster and importing it into Rancher Manager. Two alternative methods for cluster provisioning are presented: **using a GitOps workflow with Fleet** and **manually applying the manifests via `kubectl`**.

== Prerequisites

* Rancher Manager cluster with {product_name} installed
* Cluster API providers installed for your scenario - we'll be using the https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/tree/main/test/infrastructure/docker[Docker infrastructure] and https://github.com/rancher/cluster-api-provider-rke2[RKE2 bootstrap/control plane] providers in these instructions - see xref:../operator/capiprovider.adoc[Initialization for common providers using Turtles' `CAPIProvider`]

== Provision a CAPI Workload Cluster

======
GitOps using Fleet::
+
====
*Configure your Fleet repository*

To simplify the process of cluster provisioning, we will be using a series of pre-configured examples that you can find in the repository https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example.
By inspecting the contents of this repository, you will find:

. A *clusters* folder, which is where the manifests are stored.
. *cluster1.yaml* is the CAPI workload cluster definition.
. *fleet.yaml* is used to specify the configuration options for Fleet. In this case it's declaring that the cluster definition should be added to the `capi-clusters` namespace.

[NOTE]
If you prefer, you can create your own Fleet repository using the same base structure.

*Use Rancher UI to add your Fleet repository*

Now the cluster definitions are committed to a git repository they can be used to provision the clusters. To do this they will need to be imported into the Rancher Manager cluster (which is also acting as a Cluster API management cluster) using the *Continuous Delivery* feature (which uses Fleet).

. Go to Rancher Manager
. Select *Continuous Delivery* from the menu:

. Select *fleet-local* as the namespace from the top right
image:ns.png[namespace]
. Select *Git Repos* from the sidebar
. Click *Add Repository*
. Enter *clusters* as the name
. Get the *HTTPS* clone URL from your git repo
image:gh_clone.png[git clone url]
. Add the URL into the *Repository URL* field
. Change the branch name to *main*
. Click *Next*
. Click *Create*
. Click on the *clusters* name
. Watch the resources become ready
. Select *Cluster Management* from the menu
. Check your cluster has been imported
====

Manually using kubectl::
+
====
*Create your cluster definition*

To generate the YAML for the cluster, do the following:

. Open a terminal and run the following:
+
[source,bash]
----
export CLUSTER_NAME=cluster1
export CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_COUNT=1
export WORKER_MACHINE_COUNT=1
export KUBERNETES_VERSION=v1.31.4
export NAMESPACE=capi-clusters

# use the SHELL-FORMAT in envsubst to ensure we replace only the
# environment variables we exported above
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-turtles-fleet-example/templates/docker-rke2.yaml | envsubst '$CLUSTER_NAME,$CONTROL_PLANE_MACHINE_COUNT,$WORKER_MACHINE_COUNT,$KUBERNETES_VERSION,$NAMESPACE' > cluster1.yaml
----
+
. View *cluster1.yaml* to ensure there are no tokens. You can make any changes you want as well.
+
. Create the cluster using kubectl
+
[source,bash]
----
kubectl create namespace capi-clusters
kubectl apply -f cluster1.yaml
----
. Watch the resources become ready
. Select *Cluster Management* from the menu
. Check your cluster has been imported
====

======

== Mark Namespace for auto-import

To automatically import a CAPI cluster into Rancher Manager there are 2 options:

. Label a namespace so all clusters contained in it are imported.
. Label an individual cluster definition so that it's imported.

In both cases the label is `cluster-api.cattle.io/rancher-auto-import`.

This walkthrough will use the first option of importing all clusters in a namespace.

. Open a terminal
. Label the cluster's namespace in your Rancher Manager cluster:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl label namespace capi-clusters cluster-api.cattle.io/rancher-auto-import=true
----

[NOTE]
====
A namespace (or cluster) can be marked for auto-import at any time: before or after the cluster has been created.
====

[CAUTION]
====
To prevent a cluster from getting stuck in deletion when Fleet is removed, keep auto-import enabled in the UI or avoid manually removing labels in the cluster's namespace, as Turtles will no longer handle the 'import' functionality from that point onward.
