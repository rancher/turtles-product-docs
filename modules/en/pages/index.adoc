= Introduction

[CAUTION]
====
Starting with Turtles `v0.9.0`, the process used for importing CAPI clusters into Rancher is now based on a different controller logic. If you are a new user of Turtles, you can proceed normally and simply install the extension. If you have been using previous versions of Turtles and are upgrading to `v0.9.0`, we recommend you take a look at the migration mechanisms and their implications:

* xref:../tasks/maintenance/automigrate_to_v3_import.adoc[Automatic migration].
* xref:../tasks/maintenance/import_controller_upgrade.adoc[Manual migration]
====


Rancher Turtles is a Kubernetes Operator that provides integration between Rancher Manager and Cluster API (CAPI) with the aim of bringing full CAPI support to Rancher. With Rancher Turtles, you can:

* Automatically import CAPI clusters into Rancher, by installing the Rancher Cluster Agent in CAPI provisioned clusters.
* Configure the CAPI Operator.

== Demo

This demo shows how to use the Rancher UI to install Rancher Turtles, create/import a CAPI cluster, and install monitoring on the cluster:+++<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lGsr7KfBjgU?si=ORkzuAJjcdXUXMxh" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen="">++++++</iframe>+++
