= v0.25.3
:revdate: 2026-02-17
:page-revdate: {revdate}

== Release Date: 2026-02-16

== Description

[IMPORTANT]
====
This release fixes a critical issue with the {product_name} `no-cert-manager` feature which is enabled by default in Rancher v2.13.
====

This issue affects all users upgrading from {product_name} v0.24 + Rancher v2.12 to Rancher v2.13.

In particular, the CAPIProviders have a chance at not being converted correctly to remove cert-manager dependencies and the `WranglerManagedCertificates` condition will not be set.

When this is the case, conflicts with the Provider's CRDs may unexpectedly increase etcd size.

For a workaround or more information, please see: https://github.com/rancher/turtles/issues/2109[#2109].
