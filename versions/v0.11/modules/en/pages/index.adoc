[WARNING]
====
Starting with Turtles `v0.9.0`, the process used for importing CAPI clusters into Rancher is now based on a different controller logic. If you are a new user of Turtles, you can proceed normally and simply install the extension. If you have been using previous versions of Turtles and are upgrading to `v0.9.0`, we recommend you take a look at the migration mechanisms and their implications:

* xref:../tasks/maintenance/automigrate_to_v3_import.adoc[Automatic migration].
* xref:../tasks/maintenance/import_controller_upgrade.adoc[Manual migration]

{product_name} is a Kubernetes Operator that provides integration between Rancher Manager and Cluster API (CAPI) with the aim of bringing full CAPI support to Rancher. With {product_name}, you can:

* Automatically import CAPI clusters into Rancher, by installing the Rancher Cluster Agent in CAPI provisioned clusters.
* Configure the CAPI Operator.

== Demo

This demo shows how to use the Rancher UI to install {product_name}, create/import a CAPI cluster, and install monitoring on the cluster:
