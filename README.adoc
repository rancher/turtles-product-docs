= SUSE Rancher Prime Cluster API (Turtles): Product and Community Documentation

== Build the Documentation site

The repository uses [Antora Playbooks](https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/) to locally or remotely build the AsciiDoc content into a static website.

=== Prerequisites

==== git

You need git to get the source code of this repository. Run the command below to check whether git is installed on your machine.

[,console]
----
git --version
----

If you don't have git installed on your machine, download and install it for your operating system from the [git downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) page.

==== Node.js

Antora requires an active long term support (LTS) release of Node.js. Run the command below to check if you have Node.js installed, and which version. This command should return an [active Node.js LTS version number](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)

[,console]
----
node -v
----

If you don't have Node.js installed on your machine, install it, preferably via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

=== Clone the Playbook repository

Run the git command to clone this repository.

[,console]
----
git clone https://github.com/rancher/turtles-product-docs.git
----

This playbook repository uses a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) to get the custom Antora supplemental files that provide a custom GUI theme for the documentation website. Run the command below to get the submodule.

[,console]
----
git submodule update --init
----

=== Install node modules

Open a terminal at the root of the git repository. Run the command below.

[,console]
----
npm install
----

=== Run Antora to build the static website - Product example

As a local example, run the command below to build the product version of the site:

[,console]
----
npx antora turtles-local-product-playbook.yml
----

Navigate to the `./build/site-product` directory and open the index.html file in your browser to view and navigate the documentation site.

Alternatively, run the below command first and then open `http://127.0.0.1:8080/` in your browser for a web server preview:

[,console]
----
make preview-product-local
----

== Makefile

The Makefile can be used to set up your environment, build the local and remote static sites, and clean your build output directory.

=== Build the Static Website

You can use the `make` command to build the documentation site locally or remotely for either the Community or Product versions. The Makefile defines various tasks for building the site using different playbooks.

=== Example: Build the site using the development playbook - Product

For development purposes, you can build the product site using the development playbook by running:

[,console]
----
make dev-product
----

This will use the `turtles-dev-product-playbook.yml` to generate the site with development settings.

=== Preview the development build locally - Product

To preview the above example development site locally, use the command below:

[,console]
----
make preview-dev-product
----

and then open `http://127.0.0.1:8084/` in your browser for a web server preview.

=== Clean up the build:

To remove the build and temporary directories, use the following command:

[,console]
----
make clean
----

This will delete the `build` directory.

== How to report issues related to the SUSE Rancher Product Documentation

=== If you are a SUSE Rancher Customer

It is recommended to report the issue via the [SUSE Customer Center](https://scc.suse.com/)

=== If you are a SUSE Internal Employee

It is recommended to file a Jira ticket. If you do not have access to Jira then you can file a GitHub ticket on the respective product documentation repository.

== Turtles Version Updates Across Docs

This section explains how Turtles documentation versions are managed and updated when new releases are published.

=== Automated Version Bumping

The documentation repository automatically updates versions when a new Turtles release tag is pushed to the main repository. Here's how the process works:
The version bump process is triggered automatically when:

1. A new version tag (format: `v*`) is pushed to the rancher/turtles repository
2. The GitHub workflow `.github/workflows/publish-version.yaml` detects the tag and starts the process

==== What Gets Updated

The automation updates several types of version references throughout the documentation:

* **GitHub URLs**: Raw GitHub links are updated from `refs/heads/main` to `refs/tags/v{version}`
* **Environment Variables**: `TURTLES_VERSION` values in code examples
* **Helm Commands**: Version flags in `helm install` commands
* **Component Tables**: Version references in component compatibility tables

==== Version Replacement Tool

The repository includes a custom Go tool at `tools/setexampleversion/main.go` that handles version replacements:

* **Configuration**: Uses `replace-rules.json` to define replacement patterns
* **Flexible Rules**: Each rule specifies a regex pattern and replacement template

Example usage:
[,console]
----
go run tools/setexampleversion/main.go -version=v0.21.0 \
  docs/v0.21/modules/en/pages/user/installation.adoc \
  docs/v0.21/modules/en/pages/user/clusterclass.adoc
----

==== Component Version Updates

For updating component versions (Rancher, Cluster API, etc.) in the prerequisites tables, the repository includes a reusable workflow at `.github/workflows/pre-release.yaml`. This workflow can be called from other workflows to selectively update component versions in the `docs/next/` directory:

* **Selective Updates**: Only updates versions for components that are specified as inputs
* **Automatic PR Creation**: Creates a pull request with the version changes
* **Flexible Configuration**: Each component version can be updated independently

=== Manual Version Updates

For manual version updates or testing:

1. **Update the config**: Modify `replace-rules.json` if new replacement patterns are needed
2. **Run the tool**: Execute the version replacement tool with the desired version
3. **Review changes**: Check that all version references have been updated correctly
4. **Test locally**: Build and preview the documentation to ensure everything works

=== Adding New Version Patterns

When new version references are added to the documentation:

1. **Identify the pattern**: Find the exact text pattern that needs version replacement
2. **Add a rule**: Update `replace-rules.json` with a new replacement rule
3. **Test the rule**: Run the tool to verify the pattern matches correctly
4. **Document the change**: Update this README if the change affects the workflow

Example rule structure:
[,json]
----
{
  "name": "Description of what this rule updates",
  "pattern": "regex-pattern-to-match",
  "replacement": "replacement-template-with-%s-placeholder"
}
----
